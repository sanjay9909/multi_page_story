    <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, Arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".

        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[10] In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts. </p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes "a party of boys ... playing at ball".[31] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[32] date from the 12th century The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "mob football", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse,[34] struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder[35] to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.[36] The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[35] and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174â€“1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:

        After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescentsMost of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.

        An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England: "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".[38] Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.[39] Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".</p>

    <p class="para">Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.[9] Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations,[134] and has the highest television audience in sport,[135] making it the most popular in the world.[136] American football, with 1.1 million high school football players and nearly 70,000 college football players, is the most popular sport in the United States,[137][138] with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for nine of the top ten of the most watched broadcasts in U.S. television history.[139] The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue[140] out of any single professional sports league.[141] Thus, the best association football and American football players are among the highest paid athletes in the world.[142][143][144]

        Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.[145][146] Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance,[147] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.[148]
        
        Rugby union is the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji.[149] It is also the fastest growing sport in the U.S.,[150][151][152][153] with college rugby being the fastest growing[clarification needed][154][155] college sport in that country</p>
